# SimScore
## Fully functioning GUI Application (Android deployed) writen in Python.
### Tennis Score Predictor and displayer written in Python and the Kivy(MD) Framework.

To create this Application I used a package named sports.py https://github.com/evansloan/sports.py - which allowed me to gather live scores from sports.

In future builds it maybe possible to branch out to multiple different sports within the app.

To deploy the application to my Android device I used https://github.com/kivy/buildozer and a Ubuntu Linux VM.

Debugging apps on Buildozer is quite tedious however with a logcat filter and your phone plugged in deploying apps could be a lot worse despite having to set up a VM and downloads lots of dependencies.
